# Description
The *Enhance Logging* system by "flabby" for *Arma Reforger* provides detailed and persistent logging, storing data locally as `.json` files or online. Logs are categorized into `debug`, `info`, `default`, and `error` types, with formats available in simple, normal, or rich styles. A logging class delivers debug information, such as system and server times, while commands allow format changes. The initial release focuses on `SCR_GameMode` logs for server-side tracking, with options for paid online storage plans ($2.5/month for 1GB or $20/month for unlimited logging). Logs can be accessed, searched, and exported via **flabby.dev**, offering a robust solution for developers and server operators.

Logs folder structure will look like, “/flabby/logs/YEAR/MONTH/DAY”
